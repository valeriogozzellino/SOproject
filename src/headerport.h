/**
 * create_goods: This function generates type of good for offers and demands for port in a simulated trading scenario.
 * It calculates random IDs for the offered and demanded goods based on the available goods.
 * The function distributes these offers and demands across multiple days, maintaining consistent values for each good across all days.
 * It is essential for initializing the goods trading process with randomized variation across different days.

 * create_lots: This function creates lots of goods for both offers and demands.
 * It takes tonnage availability into account and distributes goods into lots based on size and availability.
 * It ensures that goods are allocated to lots in a balanced manner, considering the available tonnage for both offers and demands.
 * It plays a key role in determining the distribution and quantities of goods for trading.

 * expired_good: This function manages expired goods within the trading system.
 * It iterates through the goods and their lots, and if a good has expired and still has available lots, it updates statistics for the expired goods and clears the lots.
 * This function is important for maintaining accurate records of expired goods and managing their impact on the trading simulation.

 * check_good: This function checks the status of remaining goods and lots at a given port over the course of the simulation.
 * It prints information about goods that have not been traded, both for offers and demands.
 * Additionally, it displays the total offered and demanded goods at the specified port.

 * receive_message: This function receives and processes messages related to ship attacks on a port. Ã¹
 * It retrieves messages from a message queue and displays information about the attack event.
